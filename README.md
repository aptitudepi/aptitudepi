I'm aptitudepi! Nice to meet you!

When the Wifi works, I do miscellaneous things with various languages (Python, HTML, CSS, NodeJS/jQuery, C/C++, Java, etc.), as well as Ethical Hacking in Kali Linux and Machine Learning (using Tensorflow/Keras, Pytorch/Pytorch Lightining, XGBOOST, etc.)! I'm also wondering how I can get my Raspberry Pi cluster (specifically SLURM) to do various things!
